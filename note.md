- [AJAX](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp) = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML, it allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
### HTML
- order rule: 
> Unlike CSS and JavaScript, HTML code is executed from top to bottom so the order of your code matters.

### CSS
- UX: simplicity->space, consistency
- color meaningness: 
  - > red - energetic, yellow - attention, purple - wealth, green - food/fruit, blue - trustworthy(financial)
- position: fixed, used in the navigation bar
- center alignment->margin: 0 auto; width: 10%
- embeded font keeps consistent: fonts.google.com
- rem - the root of the body em, ignore the body {fontsize}
- Bootstrap:responsive = adaptive, desktop/pad/phone has different layout-> use class="row"->"col-md-6", instead of "col-6" (fixed in all platforms). 
- layout tips: The bigger the device(e.g.sm,md,lg), the smaller part they occupied. e.g. medium device means â‰¥768px, use 6 units=6/12=50%=apply breakpoint=large device could use, so the smaller one= [100%] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19865158/what-is-the-difference-among-col-lg-col-md-and-col-sm-in-bootstrap);)
